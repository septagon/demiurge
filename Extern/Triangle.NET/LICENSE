Note:
The code in this folder was originally copied from a ZIP archive, which did not include a license file at the time.  Though I 
have the original zipped file I downloaded, I do not know from which link I got it.  However, I believe the code originally 
comes from https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=triangle, and so is here licensed under the terms of the MIT license.  This can be
considered a fork, as it is on https://github.com/eppz/Triangle.NET.
