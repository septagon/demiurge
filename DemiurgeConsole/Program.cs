             * TODO: Let's not ignore the magnitude of the first render success just because it isn't the end of the road:
             * we just proved that we could render out the entire island -- all Madagascar-esque size of it -- down to 20
             * meter horizontal precision in 60 hours on a single CPU core.  This means that, as kinks get worked out and
             * advances are made, it's very possible to do precise and advanced reasoning about the land by actually 
             * rendering it out.
             * 
             * Now, notes about the next steps:
             *   - The single-value "canyon factor" carving of rivers in mountains is MUCH too agressive and consistent, 
             *     produces extremely characteristic and noticeable "U-valley" artifacts that show up badly in gradient
             *     analysis.  Not the end of the world, doesn't preclude most utility; but revisit the canyon/valley
             *     logic in MeterScaleMap's damping code and see if there isn't something smarter to do there.
             *   - Creating the MeterScaleMap took around half an hour; rendering the map to disk took almost three days.
             *     Run some quick performance analysis on the up-res portion to figure out what the is taking so long 
             *     (it's probably the spline tree) and see if there's something to be done about it.  Global "spline tree
             *     sample map" computed upfront?
             *   - Rivers don't meet the sea.  It's past time that we really looked deeply into this and got it solved,
             *     this should be an easy one.
             *   - Tributaries sometimes seem to narrow to nothing before they join the river they feed.  Spline tree
             *     acting weird again?  Is this one of the "endpoint mirroring" hacks coming back to bite me in the ass?
             *   - The roughness map and the base heights map need to be separated.  This is probably the quickest and
             *     easiest thing that can be done which will dramatically improve the quality of the resulting maps.  In
             *     the first render, the Kirai river rises 1200m in 80km (-0.015 slope, 20x that of the Amazon); keep in
             *     mind that the source of the Mississippi is only around 500m above sea level.
             *   - Similarly, the use of just "mountain terrain" may not be ideal long-term, although it seems to be more
             *     than adequate for right now.  Low pri, but hills?
             *   - Erosion.
